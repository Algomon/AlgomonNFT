Algomon - An Algorand NFT Art collectibles project

What is Algomon
Algomon is a project aimed at exploring the use of collectible non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Algorand blockchain. Each algomon is represented by an Algorand Standard Asset (ASA) with a limited availability.

How many Algomon are out there?
There are currently only a few dozen of "species" of different Algomon. The amount of tokens minted for each species varies based on rarity. For example, Algomon #1: Antares has been minted 1000 times, while Algomon #5: Liesma has been minted 500 times. Some ultrarare Algomon will be released in very limited amounts or only for a short period of time.

What can you do with Algomon?
Algomons are NFT art collectibles, and trading is encouraged. Most people decide to purchase them because they enjoy the art or because they plan to resell at a higher price in the future (i.e. once the assets are fully distributed). If you want to create applications or games featuring Algomons, feel free to do so - and get in touch!

Who creates Algomons? Are they copyrighted?
I create all the Algomon art by myself using royalty-free assets. Once you own an Algomon token, you are free to do what you want with it, but I still own the rights to the art and media related to that asset. You are not allowed to mint your own Algomons and sell them as part of this project. If you are creating your own project and want new Algomon to be minted for it, get in touch.

That's so cool! How do I get an Algomon?
Currently you are able to buy Algomon from Rand Gallery. Check also the r/Algomon subreddit where you can trading Algomons with other owners, and keep an eye open for airdrops and contests.

What are future projects involving Algomon?
As of present I do not plan to work on any projects beside creating and distributing Algomon, but there will be game-like features implemented and Algomon may appear on other Algorand NFT games in the future. There are many possible implementations, from Algomon-to-Algomon trading to Geocaching ("Algomon Go"), but I do not have the time nor resources to do so at the moment. If you want to work on any projects on your own, I highly encourage so and can help you set things up (and reward you with free Algomons!)
